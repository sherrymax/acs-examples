### Use-Case / Requirement

### Prerequisites to run this demo end-2-end

* Alfresco Content Services (Version 6.1 and above)
* Alfresco Demo Platform (ADP) : Only for ADP Users
* [seedim-docusign-platform-1.0-SNAPSHOT.amp](assets/seedim-docusign-platform-1.0-SNAPSHOT.amp)
* [seedim-docusign-share-1.0-SNAPSHOT.amp](assets/seedim-docusign-share-1.0-SNAPSHOT.amp)
  
## ACS - Installation Steps

### Troubleshooting

If the integration is still not working, your newly created DocuSign App needs Consent.

Perform the step, [mentioned in this document](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/auth/jwt/jwt-get-token/), for Consent Approval.

Open a browser URL with the following syntax.

```
https://account-d.docusign.com/oauth/auth?
    response_type=code
    &scope=YOUR_REQUESTED_SCOPES
    &client_id=YOUR_APP_INTEGRATION_KEY
    &redirect_uri=YOUR_APP_REDIRECT_URI
```

An example of the URL is as follows:
```
https://account-d.docusign.com/oauth/auth?
    response_type=code
    &scope=signature%20impersonation
    &client_id=0ee50bf4-613a-4c92-bac9-f61781cb57af
    &redirect_uri=http://localhost
```
The browser will provide a content box. Press `Accept` button.

The DocuSign integrations should start working now.
