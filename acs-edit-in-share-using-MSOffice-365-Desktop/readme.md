#### This article details the steps required to configure Edit in Microsoft Office 365 (Desktop Version) for Alfesco Share

### Use-Case / Requirement

The Alfresco system should let users edit Office documents in Share using MS Office 365 (Desktop Version).

### Prerequisites to run this demo end-2-end

* Alfresco Content Services (Version 6.1 and above)
* Alfresco Demo Platform (ADP) : Only for ADP Users

### Considerations when using Alfresco Office Services
  
```
Production, Staging, Development and POC Environments
-----------------------------------------------------
In these environments, Alfresco Office Services (AOS) is recommended to be configured on SSO to allow communication with the repository. You must activate SSO when using Alfresco Office Services in these environments. 
```

```
Sandbox and Demo environments
-----------------------------
Considering the need of these environments to be quickly setup, as an alternative to SSO communication, however, you would have to do some registry edits and establish the connection with the repository.
```

### Configuration Steps

1. Download and Import a [Policy Document](assets/Policy-Document.docx).

2. For <b>PROD, Staging, Dev and POC environments</b>:
   * Establish SSO. More details at [Alfresco Documentation](https://docs.alfresco.com/microsoft-office/latest/#considerations-when-using-alfresco-office-services) and (SSO configuration steps are here](<https://docs.alfresco.com/saml-module/latest/config/alfresco/#aos/admin-console>).
  
3. For <b>Sandbox/Demo environments</b>:
   * Download [basic-auth-bat-files.zip](assets/basic-auth-bat-files.zip) file.
   * Run [enable-basic-auth.bat](assets/enable-basic-auth.bat) file (as an Administrator) to enable Basic Authentication via registry edits.

        > REG ADD HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Common\Internet /v BasicAuthLevel /t REG_DWORD /d 2

   * Once testing is completed, if desired, run [disable-basic-auth.bat](assets/disable-basic-auth.bat) file (as an Administrator) to revert the changes and disable Basic Authentication.

        > REG DELETE HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Common\Internet /v BasicAuthLevel /f

    * Please find the [documentation from Microsoft about this registry edit.](<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/troubleshoot/powerpoint/office-opens-blank-from-sharepoint>)
